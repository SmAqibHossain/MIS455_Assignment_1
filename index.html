          Hi there!<br />
          <br />I'm Aqib, a computer science engineering student at Independent
          University, Bangladesh. I'm passionate about engineering and
          problem-solving, and I'm excited to share my work with you on this
          portfolio website. <br />
          <br />

          I've always been fascinated by how things work, and that's what drew
          me to engineering. As a kid, I loved taking apart my toys and trying
          to figure out how they put back together. I also loved watching
          MacGyver and being inspired by his ability to solve any problem with
          whatever he had on hand. <br />
          <br />

          Now, as a student, I'm learning the skills and knowledge I need to
          become a successful engineer. I'm also working on a number of personal
          projects, which you can explore on this website. <br />
