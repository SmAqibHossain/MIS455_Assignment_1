        <h3>Arduino Projects</h3>
        <p>
          I have extensive experience with Arduino, having created numerous
          projects with this versatile platform. I am passionate about learning
          more about Arduino and using it to create innovative and useful
          machines. My work on a pick-and-place robot for the inter-university
          competition "Techfest" is a prime example of my skills and creativity.
          The robot placed second in the competition, demonstrating its
          capabilities and potential.

        <h3>Weather Forcast Web App</h3>
        <p>
          I have created an interactive web app that provides real-time weather
          updates for any location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch
          weather data and display it in a user-friendly format. The app also
          includes a search feature that allows users to look up the weather for
          any city in the world. The app is designed to be responsive and
          accessible, making it easy to use on any device. The app can be
          accessed by clicking the button below.
